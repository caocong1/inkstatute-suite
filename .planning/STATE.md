# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-27)

**Core value:** Hermes lawfirm can be used by lawyers in WeCom while V2 records industry-neutral, privacy-aware contract events that are valid, replayable, feedback-linked, and CI-verifiable without changing Hermes outbound behavior.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Platform Contract Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 8 (Platform Contract Foundation)
Plan: Not planned yet
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-06-27 - Initialized GSD project artifacts from ingested V2 PRD intel.

Progress: [----------] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- V2 PRD is the active product specification; retired V1 is not an active requirement source.
- V2 is a thin contract layer around Hermes lawfirm, not a Hermes rebuild.
- JSON Schema and Python bindings come before TypeScript.
- Contract-test-suite precedes production Hermes hook implementation.
- Hermes integration risks are isolated into Phase 3 before production hook work.
- Lawyer trial acceptance remains a manual human gate.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Known Hermes integration risks are assigned to Phase 3: hook order, inbound turn inference, message_id stability, long-task state mapping, feedback targets, idempotency, raw payload retention, and redaction.
- Legal/safety concerns require human review when they affect high-risk legal conclusions or lawyer trial acceptance.

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and carried forward from previous milestone close:

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Beyond V2 | Independent Router Service, Skill Registry, full Web UI, Tauri desktop, automatic skill synthesis, complete security platform | Deferred to M2-M4 | V2 initialization |
